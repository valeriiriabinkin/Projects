Delicious and fresh-tasting prior to that, though.  So, keep a sharp eye on them.  Personally I would not keep them longer than a month.

Just sprinkle slices with salt of choice and give them 20-30 mins to pull the moisture out. Once they're done, rinse and pat them dry. They are now ready to bread and bake! I didn't use Italian seasoning (don't like one of the spices in it), so I just mixed in some Basil, Oregano, and Thyme. You can use a smaller baking dish, you don't need a 9X13 if you're creating 3 layers. I served this on whole wheat angel hair and instead og canned tomato sauce, I used a jar of pasta sauce. I'll definitely make it again. The first time I made this recipe I didn't salt the eggplant and it was very tough.

You can use any regular cookie dough recipe to make cookie cake, but this one tasted great even when I messed up cooking it. For a cookie cake you preferably have a pan with sides, or put tin foil or a cookie sheet under it to catch messes. I thought about making a tin foil ridge underneath but forgot to try it. Make a slight indentation in the middle, like making a burger, so it is easier to cook through in the middle. Leave an inch or two of space around the outside of the dough to allow for spreading.

Not because I was doing something from experience, but rather I am a new cook who hasn't used much paprika and was a bit hesitant to put the whole 3 tablespoons in, not sure what it would do to the taste since it was already looking and smelling so good. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I believe there is something missing (more than the paprika I left out). I'm sure adding more salt would help but instead of having to use a lot of salt I'm hoping someone else can figure out a good additional ingredient to push this yummy recipe to a 5. I made it with uncle ben's white rice (my new fav. rice) adding a spoonful of cream cheese to the rice when fluffing at the end. If you've never tried that it's really good! I would have liked to have a good vggie on the side too but couldn't decide on one so I didn't make any! Anyway it tasted so good along side the rice I began to mix it up all together spreading the sauce and fish throughout the rice. Gasp!! Just looked at the recipe again.  I think I figured it out-I left out the OJ!!!  Well, problem solved.  That prob would have given it a 5.  But hey it was still really yummy without.  Good stuff.

My advise to anyone who was going to half the recipe as I did, would be to be sure and use a small enough baking pan for how many wings you have.

Here are my suggestions: First, rewrite the directions, distilling them to just the basics (sorry Cody). I did this in my Mastercook software. I halved the recipe and came out with 2 1/2 lbs. fruit. I chopped the fruit finely but not all the way to a paste - it filled to the brim a quart mason jar. I then poured in as much rum as it would hold (maybe several cups) and turned the jar over every several days for about a month. I baked it in two regular size loaf pans for 2 3/4 hours. I would have preferred the mini loaf pans but forgot to get them. The loaves are now wrapped in cheesecloth which I've soaked several times with more rum, and then wrapped in foil. Really excellent, and definitely worth the time and trouble. Thanks, Cody!\"),\n",

Throw them in the freezer ( with peel on ) , collecting them until you get around to making the bread. No more waste of bananas in our house.

For ease, I used my food processor to chop the garlic and parsley, then added the Italian dressing, 1 t. salt and some pepper.  Marinated in a freezer bag overnight.  I cut the carrots into chunks and used lots more - they were the first to go, so I do recommend lots if your family eats them.   I added 3 small onions to my clay pot, and next time, I think I'll also add some cut up cabbage.  Also, the chicken will make its own juice in the pot.  After cooking, I put the chicken in a pan under the broiler for a couple of minutes to further brown/crisp it, removed the veggies to a serving dish, and defatted the chicken liquid to serve alongside.

       "  \"Great chicken, great recipe. For the most part I kept with the recipe.  I didn't make gravy with the giblets, because I'm not fond of giblet gravy.  I used the olive oil to rub into the skin, and I don't think I would consider it optional! I used garlic powder, dried thyme from the garden and fresh rosemary from the garden.  My only complaint was that my chicken cooked in about an hour, an hour before I had the rest of dinner ready to go! LOL  So my chicken got a nice long rest under some foil, thank goodness for thermometers.  After I started slicing the breast meat, I snitched the piece coated in all the yummy herbs for myself. :)  Nummy, and so was the thigh meat, as promised.  Thank you so much for sharing, hon!

I think it took longer than expected but I had the birds side-by-side so that may have been the reason. (Chickens alway seem to take forever to roast for me!) This was the first time I really used the technique of rubbing the seasonings under the skin. I think it is worth it... especially since I would like to avoid the extra calories of the skin. I used the larger amount of spices but made it stretch for the two birds. I used option 1 of flipping the birds over.

For me it works best on a more thinly cut french fry like that which McDonald's has and spread them out on a cookie sheet so that no fry overlaps another.  I cook them a little longer in the oven than what the recipe states and I leave the skins on for the vitamin/mineral content they supposedly add,  but that's the only thing I had to change.  The salt content in these is perfect for my tastes but for someone that does not like salt as much myself I would recommend lowering the salt used by maybe a quarter or half.  Boiling the fries in the salt water is what really makes this recipe shine.  They cook crisp on the outside and soft in the middle, unlike most the other healthy fry recipes Ive found.  Soooo yummy and as long as you are accounting for the calories, these are just fine for most of you dieters out there.  I never feel full without some carbs and am trying to lose about 10 lbs of belly fat right now so these fit the bill perfectly because they actually fill me up so Im not snacking all night.

The second time I made this, I used 6 country peach passion tea bags, but only 3 cinnamon apple spice tea bags. The brand of Apple Juice I used in this tea was... Nature's Nectar. Also, when making the tea, I just bring the water to a boil, (but not a rolling boil) then I remove it immediately from the heat; pour it into a glass pitcher, (w/the tea bags) cover the pitcher with plastic wrap, and let the tea set for 1 hour. What a difference in the taste of the tea, after it sets for an hour. Otherwise the tea is a bit weak in flavor if it's just steep for 10 minutes. I'm editing my review, as I just added a packet of Splenda to my glass of tea filled with ice, and I enjoyed the tea even better. Thanks for the recipe Juenessa.\"),\n",

Even using less rice might help. Maybe like 1 cup instead of a can full. It comes out very thick. In order for it to be creamy, you need to add milk at the very end, just before serving.

Make your own, then you can tweak it as suits your taste if you must use seasoning. You can use mild chile powder, cumin and Greek oregano. If you use Mexican oregano use only a little as it is very strong. Traditional Mexican food does not use garlic. This is all you need without all the other additives of packaged. No fillers, no preservatives and fresher this way. Canned chiles are Anaheim chiles unless you buy adobo. Anaheim chiles are very mild.
