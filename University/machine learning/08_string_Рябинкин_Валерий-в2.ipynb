      "[\"One of my sisters was in need of some comfort food, and did a search for this to avoid having to dig through my Mother's heirloom stash of recipes in search of her original, grease stained label that she peeled off of the can of Crisco! lol! My only &quot;tweaks&quot; have been to add some dill, a tablespoon of lemon/lime juice, 1/2 t. of cayenne, and I often use dried onions, they will help the patty hold it's shape well and absorb any excess moistness, and I like to lightly press each patty into a dish of panko crumbs for extra crispness, especially if &quot;oven-frying&quot;. If I choose to pan fry, (which isn't often) I pass on using shortening (sorry, Crisco!) and use a healthier oil. My fav as of late is unrefined coconut oil! It gives a great crisp and delicious flavor to everything, and has a higher smoke point that olive oil. If you do fry, skip using canola. Although it is a &quot;healthier&quot; oil, it doesn't &quot;sear&quot; well when used to fry, pan fry, etc. and your food will absorb more oil using it. If your a long time user of it, you will be really surprised at how poorly it frys compared to some of the others. My usual cook method for most things that call for frying is to use a shallow DARK non-stick pan, well coated with coconut, olive, or other oil. Placed in the oven (convection is preferable, the results will almost pass as having been actually fried) and set temp to 400-425, allowing the pan to preheat as well while preparing the food. When ready to cook, carefully place in hot pan. (for things like chicken, etc. always place skin/meaty side down first) Always cook on first side 2/3's of total time, spray or brush tops liberally with coconut oil or preference and flip. Continue cooking the remaining time until done. Do not overcook after flipping or the bottom of the food will get too dry and likely stick, you could lose your &quot;crust&quot;. For salmon patties I cook at 425f, 10 min first side, five min more after the flip. They come out crispy and golden brown. Note: If a good non-stick dark finished pan isn't available, a well seasoned cast iron skillet works great also! Remember to NEVER wash your cast iron with soap/detergent as it will &quot;unseason&quot; it and food will stick! Simply use a spatula to remove anything remaining and wipe until well cleaned and shiny. To store until next use, apply a VERY light coat of oil (coconut is best due to it's natural anti-bacterial qualities) with a paper towel. And if you have inherited any good cast iron wares but are weary of cooking with them due to looking overly-grungy from years of cooking buildup, (carbon) you can give them new life by treating them with a process I call &quot;Rebirthing&quot;. Simply place them in the oven the next time you run a self-cleaning cycle. This will &quot;cremate&quot; away any debris. After it has thoroughly cooled, wash with dish soap, scrubbing well and dry VERY thoroughly. Coat the ENTIRE pan well, all sides, handle and bottom with your choice of oil/shortening/lard (avoid butter, as it contains water) and plane right side up in an oven set to 350f on top rack and place foil or a baking sheet underneath to catch any unlikely drips. Leave enough fat inside of pan to see. After heating up look to insure inside of bottom all has a wet look from the oil. If there's enough oil in the skillet and the puddle looks off-center in the pan, note that your range is not level and put that on your project list for a later time. Let it &quot;bake&quot; for one hour, turn oven off and let cool with door CLOSED until completely cool. Remove and wipe away any excess but insure to wipe every surface to insure it is all coated to protect it from rusting. The more you use it, the more non-stick it will become, as long as you never wash it with soap. If really necessary, it can be scrubbed with a bit of salt and rinsed, wipe till completely dry and wipe down with a bit of oil. Just remember that each time you do more that a thorough wiping out after using will reduce the carbonizing your working to build up that helps it to cook so well w/out sticking! If it hasn't been used in sometime and feels slightly &quot;sticky&quot; or gummy, just well oil the interior, heat on rangetop to med-med/high for about 10 min and it should wipe out clean &amp; slick, ready for use! Remember that cast iron doesn't heat as uniformly compared to other metals, so always give it a good 5 min pre-heat. It holds heat very well, and gives a great sear, especially for meats, etc. with beautiful, crisp even browning and if well heated can cook/transfer it's heat somewhat faster. Remember that if what's in your pan lifts up easily it's time to flip. If not, it's not ready, it will let you know it is when it &quot;releases&quot; itself from the pan. And as with grilling, etc., flip only once! Note: Cast iron cookware wasn't made for smooth top ranges/cooktops and they do not play well together!\"]\n",
      "['Your vet has severly mislead you and this diet is shocking and depleted.\\r\\n\\r\\nCats need a diet similar to what wild cats eat.Cats need more meat than dogs do. Dogs need more bones.  Wild cats and wolves do not eat flour, wheat, grains, kibble, canned food, cow\\'s milk, etc. My cat and dog pack are all fed a 100% raw diet (yes, they make plenty of stomach acid, that is why animals can eat raw and do not get food poisoning) that consists of raw meat, raw organ meat, minced veggies, a few supplements, goat milk and raw egg yolks. The egg whites are the problem NOT the yolks. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you ever want to give your animal milk, use goat milk, NOT cow\\'s milk. Myenberg makes a canned goat milk that Super Walmart and most health food stores carry. Or use fresh goat milk. Cow\\'s milk is meant for baby cows. \\r\\n\\r\\nTuna is an absolute NO. It depletes an animal of certain B vitamins and will turn an animal into a \"tuna junkie.\" A much better choice is canned salmon, mackrel or sardines. Cats need MEAT and cannot maintain optimal health on fish, veggies and carbs. The reason my animals eat fish is to supplement them with Omega-3, since the meat is so high in Omega-6. \\r\\n\\r\\n*Give Your Dog a Bone* is a great book for anyone with a dog. All dogs, yes ALL dogs need raw meaty bones. Not cooked. They are descendents of wolves. Wolves do not cook their food. The bones, clean the teeth, provide proper calcium (reduces chances of hip dysplaysia) and give the dog a way to take out excess energy and stress through chewing. \\r\\n\\r\\nStop buying rawhide, cooked bones, smoked bones. You are wasting your money. ANd yes even little dogs and puppies can handle raw bones. It is a beautiful thing to see a puppy take a raw meaty bone, shake it in its mouth like it is prey and lay down and gnaw away. It is in their blood to eat raw. Good raw meaty bones, are chicken and beef ribs, chicken/turkey/pork necks, chicken backs, beef marrow bones or beef soup bones. Neck and back bones are cheap and most family owned grocers stock them regularly. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd no, raw meat does NOT make an animal aggressive. They snap at each other over bones as wolves do. There are alpha leaders and followers. The human is always alpha no matter what. I practice taking bones away from my dogs and then returning them on a regular basis so they know I am the leader. The Dog Whisperer explains this on his tv show on the National Geographic Channel.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur cats are fed whole ground chickens or ground chicken leg quarters mixed with ground beef heart and once a month ground beef liver. They cannot chew bones how dogs can. All the meat for cats is ground in a meat grinder at home. Dogs get this mix with veggies and supplements every 3 days. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNatural Nutrition for Dogs and Cats by Kymythy Schultze is another great book on raw feeding.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor more info. look up BARF diet on any search engine, and please do the research. My husband and I have been raw feeding for 5 years now with no problems. If this post helps just one person it is worth it. It took us over a year of trial and error to get it right for out pack.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven if you give your dog a nice raw bone a couple of times per week, it is better than nothing. And if you worry about them choking. Never happens. Feed large dogs or dogs that eat fast, larger bones. Keep chicken backs whole. Keep ribs and breast meat whole. Let them work for their food. And only feed an animal when they are calm. Not jumping and yelping. Calmest dog eats first in a pack.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTreat an animal as you would want to be treated if you were that animal.']\n",
      "['I made these for a Valentine\\'s day dinner and originally was going to pair it as an appetizer with asparagus and orange roughy. The fish had gone bad, so I actually made these the main course, and luckily the recipe was for 1 lb. so there was plenty for two.<br/><br/>I bought the shrimp deveined. I did my own peeling and then sliced them per the recipe instructions. I wasn\\'t sure how far to go since the recipe said not to slice them all the way through, but when you lay them flat, they don\\'t really make a heart unless the shrimp separates in the middle and stays connected at the ends.<br/><br/>Here\\'s what my Joy of Cooking says (they use the term \"butterfly\"): \"Hold so the underside is up. Slice down its length almost to the vein, to form the hinge. Spread and flatten to form the butterfly shape.\" (I\\'ll give these instructions a try next time.) There\\'s a little diagram in my edition, so if anyone wants this for reference, let me know and I\\'ll be glad to send it to you, or maybe I could upload it as a photo.<br/><br/>Anyway, to peel, wash, and cut 1 lb. of these took me at least forty minutes, so adjust your times accordingly. Or you can buy the shrimp pre-peeled to save time.<br/><br/>I used a fresh orange from the local farmer\\'s market and a lemon from my tree for the citrus juice. This batter was wonderful.<br/><br/>I don\\'t cook with butter so I used a canola oil substitute from Spectrum. I\\'m not sure it retains all the health benefits if you melt it down. It certainly did not have the consistency and ease of melting regular butter, but the taste was great.<br/><br/>I had a bit more difficulty with the jam sauce as I couldn\\'t really get it to melt and stay a liquid. As soon as it was off the heat source it started to solidify again like jam and even though I tried heating it again I couldn\\'t really get it to a sauce consistency. You may have better luck using regular butter. But the taste was amazing. I did more of a \"dollop\" than a splatter over the shrimp and it worked fine.<br/><br/>I also realized while cooking that I was actually out of hot sauce, but even if you omit this as I did, it is still wonderful. (I\\'m sure it would be delicious with a kick added too.)<br/><br/>I would recommend waiting until all the shrimp are arranged on the avocado before heating the sauce so you can put it on while still warm.<br/><br/>Temperature is really key to this recipe, which is the first gourmet appetizer I have made. While the shrimp is cooking, arrange the avocado on the plate. Have all the ingredients for the sauce ready in the pan, then as soon as your done with the avocado, heat your sauce, keeping the shrimp in the oven on \"warm\" if necessary. Once the sauce is ready, quickly put the shrimp on the avocado then dash the sauce and sesame seeds on top, and be sure to serve immediately. (I would not recommend this for a sit-out type of appetizer... much better served on plates to guests while warm.)<br/><br/>Also, one avocado was not really enough for 1 lb. of shrimp. However, since I wasn\\'t eating that much avocado due to dietary restrictions, it worked out to give my husband the full avocado which covered about five shrimp with generous size slices. For the full batch, you might need at least 2-3 avocados, or otherwise cut each slice thinner or in half to double your coverage. However, I like how the full size slice hugged the shrimp hearts. (<>)<br/><br/>The combination of the avocado with the shrimp and sauce is heavenly. A few minutes after eating this I was swooning. :)']\n",
      "[\"I made these, and was worried that they would not hold together as another reviewer stated. I could not get them to clump together like traditional crabcakes, so I just mashed them into the pan (make sure you use metal- my silicone bakeware did not work, but that was my fault, not the Chef's), and hoped for the best. After baking, I just turned the hot metal pan over on a platter, and they all fell out and looked almost like real crabcakes (but the shape of a muffin cup). I did not have quite enough fresh crab on hand, so I supplemented with some diced salad shrimp- no problem at all! I mixed Valdalia and green onion, and used fresh dill and lemon juice. The combination of stronger spices surprised me, but, we all ate the crabcakes (crab/shrimp cakes), and there were no leftovers! They were such a hit, that I made them again two nights ago, but used leftover salmon since I was still out of crab, and because of this recipe, also out of shrimp. It's a great concept, and one I will be using again and again! As a bonus, the entire house smelled like some wonderful, exotic dish. I had my oven hood on to draw some of the heat outside, and neighbors were asking what I cooked. I gave them this website for the recipe, so I can bet that Chef Garlic will be getting many more reviews before too long! <br/><br/>As an aside, I always make this lemon, dill pickle juice and onion sauce (really watery, but sorta like a tarter sauce flavor, without the mayo), when we have any sort of seafood. It makes up great on the seafood, as a pasta base, marinade, or for a sandwich the next day. But, nobody touched it when I made this recipe. My feelings were hurt about that, but it did save me some work, as I hate chopping. <br/><br/>Also, make sure you use mayo, and not that other stuff with a blue lid that doubles as a salad dressing. The sugar in the M.W. would make it way too sweet. Maybe use regular stuffing mix if you use M.W.? But, I really liked the flavor of the cornbread stuffing with the contrast of the seafood. <br/><br/>In addition, the recipe says that it makes one serving, but, we had 4.8 adults that ate from it. The 0.8 is because one is due to deliver in about 3 weeks. I'll cut the recipe in half, or perhaps freeze part of it when the extra 2.8 people go home after she gives birth. <br/><br/>Overall, I have been impressed with this recipe, and pleasently surprised by how well everyone enjoyed it. Having to please 3.8 other picky adults, I felt this was a winner since there was nothing left either time. The flavor is much stronger than any crabcake I have ever had, but with the cornbread, it was a lot more distinctive, too. If you use metal muffin tins, and just press the back of the spoon down hard on top of the muffin tin, there will be no worries about them not holding together. One high dollar famous crabcake maker on the Chesapeke had crabcakes that did not stick together as well as these, and we always go back there a few times a year because they are so good. I have found that using a local farm's organic eggs over commerical grocery store varieties seemed to help keep the cakes together. My old go to recipe for crabcakes usually fell apart all the time <br/><br/>As a personal tip, I enjoyed the ones where I only filled the cup about 1/2 way full, as they came out tasting more like the fried version since more area was able to be baked. They were amazing, and you could taste all of the flavors seperately, and melding together. Mmmm, I want them again after writing this review!\"]\n",

      "['I am in the process of prepping all of my ingredients for this dish. In addition to the Coriander being mentioned in the adding process, it isn&#039;t on the original ingredients list with the measurement so I headed to the the person in a previous review and will use 2 tsp. Secondly, The Green Cardamom is on the ingredients list, but not in the adding process. I am going to add them to the first process with the onions. I trust this will be good!!!... Okay, mission accomplished! I chose to marinade my partial bone in leg of lamb in the yogurt mixture of four garlic cloves and about a 1&quot;x2&quot; piece of ginger, minced and enough yogurt to mix through meat. I believe it created more liquid when I sauteed. I still added 2 T. of water prior to adding the next batch of spices. I chose to add 2 cups of water because I do like more sauce and I ended up with 3lbs of meat. The sauce was very loose and I wanted to achieve a more cohesive thicker sauce.. I still added the yogurt even though I had yogurt on the meat. After the 30 min. simmering on med-hi heat..the sauce hadn&#039;t reduced enough so I left the lid off and over med. heat reduced it down for about an hour and then continued to simmer it on very low heat with the lid on for another hour or so until the sauce was to the consistency that I desired. I then added the cilantro and continued... This dish turned out very nice. I had the time to simmer and reduce... just take heed, if you choose to marinade the meat in the yogurt.. you may want to stick with just adding 1 cup of water to be within the cooking time. &lt;br/&gt;My hats off to Kaypee!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; for 3 hours.']\n"
